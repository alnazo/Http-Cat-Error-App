### Project

To set up the development project, the following is required:

### Getting Started

You only need to clone the repository and open the directory in Android Studio:

Clone the repository using the following command:

 ```
 git clone https://github.com/alnazo/Http-Cat-Error-App.git
 ```

This will create a folder where you execute the command. I would always recommend creating the folder first, opening the terminal inside it, and then using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/alnazo/Http-Cat-Error-App.git .
```

If you notice, the latter command has a dot at the end, which means it will place the entire project inside the current folder.

---

Another option is to download the repository as a .zip file, which can be done from the project directory by clicking the green button located at the top right that says **<>Code**, and then selecting the option **Download ZIP** from the dropdown menu.

### About the App

This application has been created to learn about the Android development environment, using the Kotlin programming language and Jetpack Composer.

It is based on fetching images from the website:
[Http Cat](https://http.cat/)

And displaying them in an app that solely showcases the images independently from the rest of the content.
